			Long Live the Web acts almost as an open letter to every person on the web. It is a call to action for defense of The Web. In recent years, the unequivocal nature of the web has been threatened by those high in power. For example, the concept of net neutrality because extremely popular because of the fact that the U.S. government repealed many laws that protected this idea. In July 2021, President Biden signed an executive order that in part instructed the FCC to restore net neutrality rules. However this isn't the only threat to The Web's open nature. Surveillance is one of the biggest concerns surrounding The Web. Our personal information, interests, and general data can be exposed in the name of security (not to mention, our data being sold). Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web as an effort to serve humanity and connect people in a way that has never been seen before. Thus, he wants the fundamental principles of his creation to remain intact for the best.

			As We May Think is an essay that predates the invention of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Bush spoke on the fact that a technology will emerge that will be one of the most powerful tools and allow knowledge from any age to be accessed. He mentions trails that users can create for other users to access, for example an encyclopedia can be shared between users. He also believed that speech recording will make printing a much quicker and easier process. He successfully envisioned technology reaching a point where it creates a new era, which we certainly can say is The Information Age. While he may not have predicted the smartphone or supercomputers, Bush's vision, despite seeming primitive now, was truly remarkable in predicting science being pushed to a state where people are connected to things that were once thought impossible.
