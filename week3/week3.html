       I think one of the most striking things about Berger's program was the observation of the inherent silence of paintings. 
       The content of a painting speaks for itself, yet without sound. This silence acts almost as a method of immersion,
       transporting spectators into the world of the painting. I must say, in my opinion, that silence is only there when one
       is present and seeing the original painting in person. Seeing a replica doesn't give art its proper justice. But when 
       you stand in front of artistic greatness, its silence is almost eerie, especially when you consider the age and 
       circumstances of the art. There isn't anything quite like it.
