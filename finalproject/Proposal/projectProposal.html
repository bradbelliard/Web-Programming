        My idea for this project is a sustainability guide. I plan to build a website that serves as a resource for upkeeping sustainablity. My inspiration comes from the company I am currently interning for. They sell software that helps companies save on energy costs while reducing carbon emissions. Working here so far has taught me a lot about sustainability, climate change, and energy usage. I see myself becoming more aware of the little things I do that can have a impact on the environment (and my wallet).

        The website will serve as a comprehensive guide. It will inform people on the causes and impact of climate change and how they can individually make positive actions for the environment. By the time users finish navigating the website, they should have a decent understanding about climate change and sustainabilty.
